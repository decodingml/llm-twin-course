Thus, by the end of this series, you will know how to build & deploy a real ML system, not some isolated code in Notebooks (we haven\u2019t used any Notebooks at all).More precisely, these are the 3 components you will learn to build:a real-time streaming pipeline (deployed on AWS) that listens to financial news, cleans & embeds the documents, and loads them to a vector DBa fine-tuning pipeline (deployed as a serverless continuous training) that fine-tunes an LLM on financial data using QLoRA, monitors the experiments using an experiment tracker and saves the best model to a model registryan inference pipeline built in LangChain (deployed as a serverless RESTful API) that loads the fine-tuned LLM from the model registry and answers financial questions using RAG (leveraging the vector DB populated with financial news in real-time)High-level architecture of the Hands-On LLMs FREE course [Image by the Author].We will also show you how to integrate various serverless tools, such as:Comet ML: as your ML Platform;Qdrant: as your vector DB;Beam: as your serverless infrastructure.Curios?

That statement is true, but deep inside of us, we all like to get in at the best price entry for our periodical investments without knowing any technical analysis. If we do that, with the magic of compounding, our gains would be a lot better over long periods.The goal of this paper is to implement a Deep Reinforcement Agent that knows when is the best moment to buy or sell an asset from your portfolio. This is a summary of the paper Universal Trading for Order Execution with Oracle Policy Distillation written at Microsoft Research.What is Order Execution?Order Execution is the ability to buy an asset with a given amount of cash at the best price and with minimal impact on the market. The same applies. selling a specific asset. It is different than trading because you don\u2019t buy or sell often. In an order execution setup you buy for the long term, but at the best moment given a period of time. You just make changes to your portfolio. For example today we want to buy 600 shares of Apple to hold them long-term. How do we buy them? Do we buy them randomly?sourceWhat Data Do We Need?The paper uses a time horizon of one day. That means that on a specific day the agent has to buy/sell X units of an asset.Two types of variables are defined:Public Variables: a time series of prices & volumes of an asset within a day.Private Variables: how much time does the agent has left until the end of the day & how many units does it still have to buy or sell.Reinforcement Learning ComponentsAgentCreate an account to read\u00a0the\u00a0full\u00a0story.The\u00a0author made this story available to\u00a0Medium\u00a0members\u00a0only.If you\u2019re new to Medium, create a new account to read this story on us.Continue in appOr, continue in mobile webSign up with GoogleSign up with FacebookSign up with emailAlready have an account?

Therefore, you still have to write clean, maintainable, and scalable software.I want to take a software engineering approach in this article when looking at ML applications. What do software engineers love most?\u2026 Design patterns, that's right.Therefore, I researched, compiled, and added examples of 10 design patterns that I found valuable when designing ML applications in Python (but can easily be applied in your language of choice).Note: I excluded well-known patterns used in Python, such as decorators, singletons, and mixins (but I recommend you read about those if you are unfamiliar with them).Creational Patterns:#1. Factory MethodProblem: When you start your new shiny application, you construct objects randomly across your code. But as you expected, it all became a huge mess. Also, your code is invaded by if statements and disjoint interfaces that are a horror to maintain. That\u2019s why you need a better way to build new objects.Solution: Using the factory method pattern, you can refactor all your creational code in a single method. By doing that, you eliminate duplication and force the code to use a single interface. Therefore, you can quickly swap different implementations of the interface through inheritance.ML use-case: From my experience, the factory method pattern is the most useful, common, and powerful SWE good practice I use in my ML projects. It is a simple concept used to construct your models, pipelines, and evaluators in a clean and maintainable way. Using this method, you eliminate duplication by having a centralized way to construct all these resources (we all know how messy the initialization of models can be). Thus based on your configuration file, you easily inject the objects of your choice.#2.
