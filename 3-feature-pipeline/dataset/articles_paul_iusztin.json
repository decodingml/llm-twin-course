The LLM twin conceptThe 3-pipeline architectureLLM twin system design🔗 Check out the code on GitHub [1] and support us with a ⭐️1. What are you going to build? The LLM twin conceptThe outcome of this course is to learn to build your own AI replica. We will use an LLM to do that, hence the name of the course: LLM Twin: Building Your Production-Ready AI Replica.But what is an LLM twin?Shortly, your LLM twin will be an AI character who writes like you, using your writing style and personality.It will not be you. It will be your writing copycat.More concretely, you will build an AI replica that writes social media posts or technical articles (like this one) using your own voice.Why not directly use ChatGPT? You may ask…When trying to generate an article or post using an LLM, the results tend to:be very generic and unarticulated,contain misinformation (due to hallucination),require tedious prompting to achieve the desired result.But here is what we are going to do to fix that ↓↓↓First, we will fine-tune an LLM on your digital data gathered from LinkedIn, Medium, Substack and GitHub.By doing so, the LLM will align with your writing style and online personality. It will teach the LLM to talk like the online version of yourself.Have you seen the universe of AI characters Meta released in 2024 in the Messenger app? If not, you can learn more about it here [2].To some extent, that is what we are going to build.But in our use case, we will focus on an LLM twin who writes social media posts or articles that reflect and articulate your voice.For example, we can ask your LLM twin to write a LinkedIn post about LLMs. Instead of writing some generic and unarticulated post about LLMs (e.g., what ChatGPT will do), it will use your voice and style.Secondly, we will give the LLM access to a vector DB to access external information to avoid hallucinating. Thus, we will force the LLM to write only based on concrete data.Ultimately, in addition to accessing the vector DB for information, you can provide external links that will act as the building block of the generation process.For example, we can modify the example above to: “Write me a 1000-word LinkedIn post about LLMs based on the article from this link: [URL].”Excited? Let’s get started 🔥2. The 3-pipeline architectureWe all know how messy ML systems can get. That is where the 3-pipeline architecture kicks in.The 3-pipeline design brings structure and modularity to your ML system while improving your MLOps processes.ProblemDespite advances in MLOps tooling, transitioning from prototype to production remains challenging.In 2022, only 54% of the models get into production. Auch.So what happens?Maybe the first things that come to your mind are:the model is not mature enoughsecurity risks (e.g., data privacy)not enough dataTo some extent, these are true.But the reality is that in many scenarios……the architecture of the ML system is built with research in mind, or the ML system becomes a massive monolith that is extremely hard to refactor from offline to online.So, good SWE processes and a well-defined architecture are as crucial as using suitable tools and models with high accuracy.Solution→ The 3-pipeline architectureLet’s understand what the 3-pipeline design is.It is a mental map that helps you simplify the development process and split your monolithic ML pipeline into 3 components:1. the feature pipeline2. the training pipeline3. the inference pipeline…also known as the Feature/Training/Inference (FTI) architecture.#1. The feature pipeline transforms your data into features & labels, which are stored and versioned in a feature store. The feature store will act as the central repository of your features. That means that features can be accessed and shared only through the feature store.#2. The training pipeline ingests a specific version of the features & labels from the feature store and outputs the trained model weights, which are stored and versioned inside a model registry. The models will be accessed and shared only through the model registry.#3. The inference pipeline uses a given version of the features from the feature store and downloads a specific version of the model from the model registry. Its final goal is to output the predictions to a client.The 3-pipeline architecture [Image by the Author].This is why the 3-pipeline design is so beautiful:- it is intuitive- it brings structure, as on a higher level, all ML systems can be reduced to these 3 components- it defines a transparent interface between the 3 components, making it easier for multiple teams to collaborate- the ML system has been built with modularity in mind since the beginning- the 3 components can easily be divided between multiple teams (if necessary)- every component can use the best stack of technologies available for the job- every component can be deployed, scaled, and monitored independently- the feature pipeline can easily be either batch, streaming or bothBut the most important benefit is that……by following this pattern, you know 100% that your ML model will move out of your Notebooks into production.↳ If you want to learn more about the 3-pipeline design, I recommend this excellent article [3] written by Jim Dowling, one of the creators of the FTI architecture.3. LLM Twin System designLet’s understand how to apply the 3-pipeline architecture to our LLM system.The architecture of the LLM twin is split into 4 Python microservices:The data collection pipelineThe feature pipelineThe training pipelineThe inference pipelineLLM twin system architecture [Image by the Author]As you can see, the data collection pipeline doesn’t follow the 3-pipeline design. Which is true.It represents the data pipeline that sits before the ML system.The data engineering team usually implements it, and its scope is to gather, clean, normalize and store the data required to build dashboards or ML models.But let’s say you are part of a small team and have to build everything yourself, from data gathering to model deployment.Thus, we will show you how the data pipeline nicely fits and interacts with the FTI architecture.Now, let’s zoom in on each component to understand how they work individually and interact with each other. ↓↓↓3.1. The data collection pipelineIts scope is to crawl data for a given user from:Medium (articles)Substack (articles)LinkedIn (posts)GitHub (code)As every platform is unique, we implemented a different Extract Transform Load (ETL) pipeline for each website.🔗 1-min read on ETL pipelines [4]However, the baseline steps are the same for each platform.Thus, for each ETL pipeline, we can abstract away the following baseline steps:log in using your credentialsuse selenium to crawl your profileuse BeatifulSoup to parse the HTMLclean & normalize the extracted HTMLsave the normalized (but still raw) data to Mongo DBImportant note: We are crawling only our data, as most platforms do not allow us to access other people’s data due to privacy issues. But this is perfect for us, as to build our LLM twin, we need only our own digital data.Why Mongo DB?We wanted a NoSQL database that quickly allows us to store unstructured data (aka text).How will the data pipeline communicate with the feature pipeline?We will use the Change Data Capture (CDC) pattern to inform the feature pipeline of any change on our Mongo DB.🔗 1-min read on the CDC pattern [5]To explain the CDC briefly, a watcher listens 24/7 for any CRUD operation that happens to the Mongo DB.The watcher will issue an event informing us what has been modified. We will add that event to a RabbitMQ queue.The feature pipeline will constantly listen to the queue, process the messages, and add them to the Qdrant vector DB.For example, when we write a new document to the Mongo DB, the watcher creates a new event. The event is added to the RabbitMQ queue; ultimately, the feature pipeline consumes and processes it.Doing this ensures that the Mongo DB and vector DB are constantly in sync.With the CDC technique, we transition from a batch ETL pipeline (our data pipeline) to a streaming pipeline (our feature pipeline).Using the CDC pattern, we avoid implementing a complex batch pipeline to compute the difference between the Mongo DB and vector DB. This approach can quickly get very slow when working with big data.Where will the data pipeline be deployed?The data collection pipeline and RabbitMQ service will be deployed to AWS. We will also use the freemium serverless version of Mongo DB.3.2. The feature pipelineThe feature pipeline is implemented using Bytewax (a Rust streaming engine with a Python interface). Thus, in our specific use case, we will also refer to it as a streaming ingestion pipeline.It is an entirely different service than the data collection pipeline.How does it communicate with the data pipeline?As explained above, the feature pipeline communicates with the data pipeline through a RabbitMQ queue.Currently, the streaming pipeline doesn’t care how the data is generated or where it comes from.It knows it has to listen to a given queue, consume messages from there and process them.By doing so, we decouple the two components entirely. In the future, we can easily add messages from multiple sources to the queue, and the streaming pipeline will know how to process them. The only rule is that the messages in the queue should always respect the same structure/interface.What is the scope of the feature pipeline?It represents the ingestion component of the RAG system.It will take the raw data passed through the queue and:clean the data;chunk it;embed it using the embedding models from Superlinked;load it to the Qdrant vector DB.Every type of data (post, article, code) will be processed independently through its own set of classes.Even though all of them are text-based, we must clean, chunk and embed them using different strategies, as every type of data has its own particularities.What data will be stored?The training pipeline will have access only to the feature store, which, in our case, is represented by the Qdrant vector DB.Note that a vector DB can also be used as a NoSQL DB.With these 2 things in mind, we will store in Qdrant 2 snapshots of our data:1. The cleaned data (without using vectors as indexes — store them in a NoSQL fashion).2. The cleaned, chunked, and embedded data (leveraging the vector indexes of Qdrant)The training pipeline needs access to the data in both formats as we want to fine-tune the LLM on standard and augmented prompts.With the cleaned data, we will create the prompts and answers.With the chunked data, we will augment the prompts (aka RAG).Why implement a streaming pipeline instead of a batch pipeline?There are 2 main reasons.The first one is that, coupled with the CDC pattern, it is the most efficient way to sync two DBs between each other. Otherwise, you would have to implement batch polling or pushing techniques that aren’t scalable when working with big data.Using CDC + a streaming pipeline, you process only the changes to the source DB without any overhead.The second reason is that by doing so, your source and vector DB will always be in sync. Thus, you will always have access to the latest data when doing RAG.Why Bytewax?Bytewax is a streaming engine built in Rust that exposes a Python interface. We use Bytewax because it combines Rust’s impressive speed and reliability with the ease of use and ecosystem of Python. It is incredibly light, powerful, and easy for a Python developer.Where will the feature pipeline be deployed?The feature pipeline will be deployed to AWS. We will also use the freemium serverless version of Qdrant.3.3. The training pipelineHow do we have access to the training features?As highlighted in section 3.2, all the training data will be accessed from the feature store. In our case, the feature store is the Qdrant vector DB that contains:the cleaned digital data from which we will create prompts & answers;we will use the chunked & embedded data for RAG to augment the cleaned data.We will implement a different vector DB retrieval client for each of our main types of data (posts, articles, code).We must do this separation because we must preprocess each type differently before querying the vector DB, as each type has unique properties.Also, we will add custom behavior for each client based on what we want to query from the vector DB. But more on this in its dedicated lesson.What will the training pipeline do?The training pipeline contains a data-to-prompt layer that will preprocess the data retrieved from the vector DB into prompts.It will also contain an LLM fine-tuning module that inputs a HuggingFace dataset and uses QLoRA to fine-tune a given LLM (e.g., Mistral). By using HuggingFace, we can easily switch between different LLMs so we won’t focus too much on any specific LLM.All the experiments will be logged into Comet ML’s experiment tracker.We will use a bigger LLM (e.g., GPT4) to evaluate the results of our fine-tuned LLM. These results will be logged into Comet’s experiment tracker.Where will the production candidate LLM be stored?We will compare multiple experiments, pick the best one, and issue an LLM production candidate for the model registry.After, we will inspect the LLM production candidate manually using Comet’s prompt monitoring dashboard. If this final manual check passes, we will flag the LLM from the model registry as accepted.A CI/CD pipeline will trigger and deploy the new LLM version to the inference pipeline.Where will the training pipeline be deployed?The training pipeline will be deployed to Qwak.Qwak is a serverless solution for training and deploying ML models. It makes scaling your operation easy while you can focus on building.Also, we will use the freemium version of Comet ML for the following:experiment tracker;model registry;prompt monitoring.3.4. The inference pipelineThe inference pipeline is the final component of the LLM system. It is the one the clients will interact with.It will be wrapped under a REST API. The clients can call it through HTTP requests, similar to your experience with ChatGPT or similar tools.How do we access the features?To access the feature store, we will use the same Qdrant vector DB retrieval clients as in the training pipeline.In this case, we will need the feature store to access the chunked data to do RAG.How do we access the fine-tuned LLM?The fine-tuned LLM will always be downloaded from the model registry based on its tag (e.g., accepted) and version (e.g., v1.0.2, latest, etc.).How will the fine-tuned LLM be loaded?Here we are in the inference world.Thus, we want to optimize the LLM's speed and memory consumption as much as possible. That is why, after downloading the LLM from the model registry, we will quantize it.What are the components of the inference pipeline?The first one is the retrieval client used to access the vector DB to do RAG. This is the same module as the one used in the training pipeline.After we have a query to prompt the layer, that will map the prompt and retrieved documents from Qdrant into a prompt.After the LLM generates its answer, we will log it to Comet’s prompt monitoring dashboard and return it to the clients.For example, the client will request the inference pipeline to:“Write a 1000-word LinkedIn post about LLMs,” and the inference pipeline will go through all the steps above to return the generated post.Where will the inference pipeline be deployed?The inference pipeline will be deployed to Qwak.By default, Qwak also offers autoscaling solutions and a nice dashboard to monitor all the production environment resources.As for the training pipeline, we will use a serverless freemium version of Comet for its prompt monitoring dashboard.ConclusionThis is the 1st article of the LLM Twin: Building Your Production-Ready AI Replica free course.In this lesson, we presented what you will build during the course.After we briefly discussed how to design ML systems using the 3-pipeline design.Ultimately, we went through the system design of the course and presented the architecture of each microservice and how they interact with each other:The data collection pipelineThe feature pipelineThe training pipelineThe inference pipelineIn Lesson 2, we will dive deeper into the data collection pipeline, learn how to implement crawlers for various social media platforms, clean the gathered data, store it in a Mongo DB, and finally, show you how to deploy it to AWS.🔗 Check out the code on GitHub [1] and support us with a ⭐️Have you enjoyed this article?

All the communication is done through the feature store.To avoid repeating myself, if you are unfamiliar with the 3 pipeline architecture, check out Lesson 1 for a refresher.By the end of this article, you will learn to design and build a production-ready feature pipeline that:uses Bytewax as a stream engine to process data in real-time;ingests data from a RabbitMQ queue;uses SWE practices to process multiple data types: posts, articles, code;cleans, chunks, and embeds data for LLM fine-tuning and RAG;loads the features to a Qdrant vector DB.Note: In our use case, the feature pipeline is also a streaming pipeline, as we use a Bytewax streaming engine. Thus, we will use these words interchangeably.We will wrap up Lesson 4 by showing you how to deploy the feature pipeline to AWS and integrate it with the components from previous lessons: data collection pipeline, MongoDB, and CDC.In the 5th lesson, we will go through the vector DB retrieval client, where we will teach you how to query the vector DB and improve the accuracy of the results using advanced retrieval techniques.Excited?

Why are we doing this?A quick reminder from previous lessonsTo give you some context, in Lesson 2, we crawl data from LinkedIn, Medium, and GitHub, normalize it, and load it to MongoDB.In Lesson 3, we are using CDC to listen to changes to the MongoDB database and emit events in a RabbitMQ queue based on any CRUD operation done on MongoDB.…and here we are in Lesson 4, where we are building the feature pipeline that listens 24/7 to the RabbitMQ queue for new events to process and load them to a Qdrant vector DB.The problem we are solvingIn our LLM Twin use case, the feature pipeline constantly syncs the MongoDB warehouse with the Qdrant vector DB while processing the raw data into features.Important: In our use case, the Qdrant vector DB will be our feature store.Why we are solving itThe feature store will be the central point of access for all the features used within the training and inference pipelines.For consistency and simplicity, we will refer to different formats of our text data as “features.”→ The training pipeline will use the feature store to create fine-tuning datasets for your LLM twin.→ The inference pipeline will use the feature store for RAG.For reliable results (especially for RAG), the data from the vector DB must always be in sync with the data from the data warehouse.The question is, what is the best way to sync these 2?Other potential solutionsThe most common solution is probably to use a batch pipeline that constantly polls from the warehouse, computes a difference between the 2 databases, and updates the target database.The issue with this technique is that computing the difference between the 2 databases is extremely slow and costly.Another solution is to use a push technique using a webhook. Thus, on any CRUD change in the warehouse, you also update the source DB.The biggest issue here is that if the webhook fails, you have to implement complex recovery logic.Lesson 3 on CDC covers more of this.2. System design of the feature pipeline: our solutionOur solution is based on CDC, a queue, a streaming engine, and a vector DB:→ CDC adds any change made to the Mongo DB to the queue (read more in Lesson 3).→ the RabbitMQ queue stores all the events until they are processed.→ The Bytewax streaming engine cleans, chunks, and embeds the data.→ A streaming engine works naturally with a queue-based system.→ The data is uploaded to a Qdrant vector DB on the flyWhy is this powerful?Here are 4 core reasons:The data is processed in real-time.Out-of-the-box recovery system: If the streaming pipeline fails to process a message will be added back to the queueLightweight: No need for any diffs between databases or batching too many recordsNo I/O bottlenecks on the source database→ It solves all our problems!The architecture of the feature/streaming pipeline.How is the data stored?We store 2 snapshots of our data in the feature store. Here is why ↓Remember that we said that the training and inference pipeline will access the features only from the feature store, which, in our case, is the Qdrant vector DB?Well, if we had stored only the chunked & embedded version of the data, that would have been useful only for RAG but not for fine-tuning.Thus, we make an additional snapshot of the cleaned data, which will be used by the training pipeline.Afterward, we pass it down the streaming flow for chunking & embedding.How do we process multiple data types?How do you process multiple types of data in a single streaming pipeline without writing spaghetti code?Yes, that is for you, data scientists! Joking…am I?We have 3 data types: posts, articles, and code.Each data type (and its state) will be modeled using Pydantic models.To process them we will write a dispatcher layer, which will use a creational factory pattern [9] to instantiate a handler implemented for that specific data type (post, article, code) and operation (cleaning, chunking, embedding).The handler follows the strategy behavioral pattern [10].Intuitively, you can see the combination between the factory and strategy patterns as follows:Initially, we know we want to clean the data, but as we don’t know the data type, we can’t know how to do so.What we can do, is write the whole code around the cleaning code and abstract away the login under a Handler() interface (aka the strategy).When we get a data point, the factory class creates the right cleaning handler based on its type.Ultimately the handler is injected into the rest of the system and executed.By doing so, we can easily isolate the logic for a given data type & operation while leveraging polymorphism to avoid filling up the code with 1000x “if else” statements.We will dig into the implementation in future sections.Streaming over batchYou may ask why we need a streaming engine instead of implementing a batch job that polls the messages at a given frequency.That is a valid question.The thing is that…Nowadays, using tools such as Bytewax makes implementing streaming pipelines a lot more frictionless than using their JVM alternatives.The key aspect of choosing a streaming vs. a batch design is real-time synchronization between your source and destination DBs.In our particular case, we will process social media data, which changes fast and irregularly.Also, for our digital twin, it is important to do RAG on up-to-date data. We don’t want to have any delay between what happens in the real world and what your LLM twin sees.That being said choosing a streaming architecture seemed natural in our use case.3. The Bytewax streaming flowThe Bytewax flow is the central point of the streaming pipeline. It defines all the required steps, following the next simplified pattern: “input -> processing -> output”.As I come from the AI world, I like to see it as the “graph” of the streaming pipeline, where you use the input(), map(), and output() Bytewax functions to define your graph, which in the Bytewax world is called a “flow”.As you can see in the code snippet below, we ingest posts, articles or code messages from a RabbitMQ queue. After we clean, chunk and embed them. Ultimately, we load the cleaned and embedded data to a Qdrant vector DB, which in our LLM twin use case will represent the feature store of our system.To structure and validate the data, between each Bytewax step, we map and pass a different Pydantic model based on its current state: raw, cleaned, chunked, or embedded.Bytewax flow → GitHub Code ⃪←We have a single streaming pipeline that processes everything.As we ingest multiple data types (posts, articles, or code snapshots), we have to process them differently.To do this the right way, we implemented a dispatcher layer that knows how to apply data-specific operations based on the type of message.More on this in the next sections ↓Why Bytewax?Bytewax is an open-source streaming processing framework that:- is built in Rust ⚙️ for performance- has Python 🐍 bindings for leveraging its powerful ML ecosystem… so, for all the Python fanatics out there, no more JVM headaches for you.Jokes aside, here is why Bytewax is so powerful ↓- Bytewax local setup is plug-and-play- can quickly be integrated into any Python project (you can go wild — even use it in Notebooks)- can easily be integrated with other Python packages (NumPy, PyTorch, HuggingFace, OpenCV, SkLearn, you name it)- out-of-the-box connectors for Kafka and local files, or you can quickly implement your ownWe used Bytewax to build the streaming pipeline for the LLM Twin course and loved it.To learn more about Bytewax, go and check them out. They are open source, so no strings attached → Bytewax [2] ←4. Pydantic data modelsLet’s take a look at what our Pydantic models look like.First, we defined a set of base abstract models for using the same parent class across all our components.Pydantic base model structure → GitHub Code ⃪←Afterward, we defined a hierarchy of Pydantic models for:all our data types: posts, articles, or codeall our states: raw, cleaned, chunked, and embeddedThis is how the set of classes for the posts will look like ↓Pydantic posts model structure → GitHub Code ⃪←We repeated the same process for the articles and code model hierarchy.Check out the other data classes on our GitHub.Why is keeping our data in Pydantic models so powerful?There are 4 main criteria:every field has an enforced type: you are ensured the data types are going to be correctthe fields are automatically validated based on their type: for example, if the field is a string and you pass an int, it will through an errorthe data structure is clear and verbose: no more clandestine dicts that you never know what is in themyou make your data the first-class citizen of your program5. Load data to QdrantThe first step is to implement our custom Bytewax DynamicSink class ↓Qdrant DynamicSink → GitHub Code ⃪←Next, for every type of operation we need (output cleaned or embedded data ) we have to subclass the StatelessSinkPartition Bytewax class (they also provide a stateful option → more in their docs)An instance of the class will run on every partition defined within the Bytewax deployment.In the course, we are using a single partition per worker. But, by adding more partitions (and workers), you can quickly scale your Bytewax pipeline horizontally.Qdrant worker partitions → GitHub Code ⃪←Note that we used Qdrant’s Batch method to upload all the available points at once. By doing so, we reduce the latency on the network I/O side: more on that here [8] ←The RabbitMQ streaming input follows a similar pattern. Check it out here ←6. The dispatcher layerNow that we have the Bytewax flow and all our data models.How do we map a raw data model to a cleaned data model?→ All our domain logic is modeled by a set of Handler() classes.For example, this is how the handler used to map a PostsRawModel to a PostCleanedModel looks like ↓Handler hierarchy of classes → GitHub Code ⃪←Check out the other handlers on our GitHub:→ ChunkingDataHandler and EmbeddingDataHandlerIn the next sections, we will explore the exact cleaning, chunking and embedding logic.Now, to build our dispatcher, we need 2 last components:a factory class: instantiates the right handler based on the type of the eventa dispatcher class: the glue code that calls the factory class and handlerHere is what the cleaning dispatcher and factory look like ↓The dispatcher and factory classes → GitHub Code ⃪←Check out the other dispatchers on our GitHub.By repeating the same logic, we will end up with the following set of dispatchers:RawDispatcher (no factory class required as the data is not processed)CleaningDispatcher (with a ChunkingHandlerFactory class)ChunkingDispatcher (with a ChunkingHandlerFactory class)EmbeddingDispatcher (with an EmbeddingHandlerFactory class)7. Preprocessing steps: Clean, chunk, embedHere we will focus on the concrete logic used to clean, chunk, and embed a data point.Note that this logic is wrapped by our handler to be integrated into our dispatcher layer using the Strategy behavioral pattern [10].We already described that in the previous section. Thus, we will directly jump into the actual logic here, which can be found in the utils module of our GitHub repository.Note: These steps are experimental. Thus, what we present here is just the first iteration of the system. In a real-world scenario, you would experiment with different cleaning, chunking or model versions to improve it on your data.CleaningThis is the main utility function used to clean the text for our posts, articles, and code.Out of simplicity, we used the same logic for all the data types, but after more investigation, you would probably need to adapt it to your specific needs.For example, your posts might start containing some weird characters, and you don’t want to run the “unbold_text()” or “unitalic_text()” functions on your code data point as is completely redundant.Cleaning logic → GitHub Code ⃪←Most of the functions above are from the unstructured [3] Python package. It is a great tool for quickly finding utilities to clean text data.🔗 More examples of unstructured here [3] ←One key thing to notice is that at the cleaning step, we just want to remove all the weird, non-interpretable characters from the text.Also, we want to remove redundant data, such as extra whitespace or URLs, as they do not provide much value.These steps are critical for our tokenizer to understand and efficiently transform our string input into numbers that will be fed into the transformer models.Note that when using bigger models (transformers) + modern tokenization techniques, you don’t need to standardize your dataset too much.For example, it is redundant to apply lemmatization or stemming, as the tokenizer knows how to split your input into a commonly used sequence of characters efficiently, and the transformers can pick up the nuances of the words.💡 What is important at the cleaning step is to throw out the noise.ChunkingWe are using Langchain to chunk our text.We use a 2 step strategy using Langchain’s RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter [4] and SentenceTransformersTokenTextSplitter [5]. As seen below ↓Chunking logic → GitHub Code ⃪←Overlapping your chunks is a common pre-indexing RAG technique, which helps to cluster chunks from the same document semantically.Again, we are using the same chunking logic for all of our data types, but to get the most out of it, we would probably need to tweak the separators, chunk_size, and chunk_overlap parameters for our different use cases.But our dispatcher + handler architecture would easily allow us to configure the chunking step in future iterations.EmbeddingThe data preprocessing, aka the hard part is done.Now we just have to call an embedding model to create our vectors.Embedding logic → GitHub Code ⃪←We used the all-MiniLm-L6-v2 [6] from the sentence-transformers library to embed our articles and posts: a lightweight embedding model that can easily run in real-time on a 2 vCPU machine.As the code data points contain more complex relationships and specific jargon to embed, we used a more powerful embedding model: hkunlp/instructor-xl [7].This embedding model is unique as it can be customized on the fly with instructions based on your particular data. This allows the embedding model to specialize on your data without fine-tuning, which is handy for embedding pieces of code.8. The AWS infrastructureIn Lesson 2, we covered how to deploy the data collection pipeline that is triggered by a link to Medium, Substack, LinkedIn or GitHub → crawls the given link → saves the crawled information to a MongoDB.In Lesson 3, we explained how to deploy the CDC components that emit events to a RabbitMQ queue based on any CRUD operation done to MongoDB.What is left is to deploy the Bytewax streaming pipeline and Qdrant vector DB.We will use Qdrant’s self-hosted option, which is easy to set up and scale.To test things out, they offer a Free Tier plan for up to a 1GB cluster, which is more than enough for our course.→ We explained in our GitHub repository how to configure Qdrant.AWS infrastructure of the feature/streaming pipeline.The last piece of the puzzle is the Bytewax streaming pipeline.As we don’t require a GPU and the streaming pipeline needs to run 24/7, we will deploy it to AWS Fargate, a cost-effective serverless solution from AWS.As a serverless solution, Fargate allows us to deploy our code quickly and scale it fast in case of high traffic.How do we deploy the streaming pipeline code to Fargate?Using GitHub Actions, we wrote a CD pipeline that builds a Docker image on every new commit made on the main branch.After, the Docker image is pushed to AWS ECR. Ultimately, Fargate pulls the latest version of the Docker image.This is a common CD pipeline to deploy your code to AWS services.Why not use lambda functions, as we did for the data pipeline?An AWS lambda function executes a function once and then closes down.This worked perfectly for the crawling logic, but it won't work for our streaming pipeline, which has to run 24/7.9. Run the code locallyTo quickly test things up, we wrote a docker-compose.yaml file to spin up the MongoDB, RabbitMQ queue and Qdrant vector db.You can spin up the Docker containers using our Makefile by running the following:make local-start-infraTo fully test the Bytewax streaming pipeline, you have to start the CDC component by running:make local-start-cdcUltimately, you start the streaming pipeline:make local-bytewaxTo simulate the data collection pipeline, mock it as follows:make local-insert-data-mongoThe README of our GitHub repository provides more details on how to run and set up everything.10. Deploy the code to AWS & Run it from the cloudThis article is already too long, so I won’t go into the details of how to deploy the AWS infrastructure described above and test it out here.But to give you some insights, we have used Pulumi as our infrastructure as a code (IaC) tool, which will allow you to spin it quickly with a few commands.Also, I won’t let you hang on to this one. We made a promise and… ↓We prepared step-by-step instructions in the README of our GitHub repository on how to use Pulumni to spin up the infrastructure and test it out.ConclusionNow you know how to write streaming pipelines like a PRO!In Lesson 4, you learned how to:design a feature pipeline using the 3-pipeline architecturewrite a streaming pipeline using Bytewax as a streaming engineuse a dispatcher layer to write a modular and flexible application to process multiple types of data (posts, articles, code)load the cleaned and embedded data to Qdrantdeploy the streaming pipeline to AWS→ This is only the ingestion part used for fine-tuning LLMs and RAG.In Lesson 5, you will learn how to write a retrieval client for the 3 data types using good SWE practices and improve the retrieval accuracy using advanced retrieval & post-retrieval techniques.
